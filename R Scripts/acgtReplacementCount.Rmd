This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
suppressMessages(library(DBI))
suppressMessages(library(RMySQL))
library(dplyr)
dbcon.hgmd <- dbConnect(MySQL(),user = "root", password = "paparam", host = "localhost", db = "hgmd_pro") # connect to database hgmd_pro in local server
mut.tbl = dbReadTable(dbcon.hgmd,name = 'mutation')
bases = mut.tbl[3]
a =0; b = 0; c = 0; d = 0;
rama = function(x){
  strings = strsplit(x,"-")
  first = strings[1]
  second = strings[2]
  return(second)
}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
