This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#make sure local mysql server is running
suppressMessages(library(DBI))
suppressMessages(library(RMySQL))
dbcon.hgmd <- dbConnect(MySQL(),user = "root", password = "paparam", host = "localhost", db = "hgmd_snp") # connect to database hgmd_pro in local server
tbl <- dbReadTable(conn = dbcon.hgmd, name = "goterms")
#group by Go term acc number 

goterms.group <- tbl%>%
  subset(!is.na(go_term_acc))%>% #selects records with no go_term_acc = NA 
  group_by(go_term_acc)%>% #group record according to go_term_acc
  summarise(count = n())%>% # count records for each go_term_acc
  arrange(-count)# order by decreasing number of records

#store the goterms.group into a text file
write.table(goterms.group, file = "go-terms-acc-Count.txt", sep = "\t") 
head(goterms.group)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
